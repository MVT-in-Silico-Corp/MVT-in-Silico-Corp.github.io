<h4>MVT <i>in</i> Silico, A Human Relevant Life Sciences Pre-Clinical R&D Company</h4>
<p> At MVT <i>in</i> Silico, we redefine pre-clinical R&D for drug development & drug-device combination development through the use of
non-animal technologies that are more cost effective and reduce R&D cycles. The outcome of our approach is a more efficient 
and reliable path to bringing new human trearments to clinical trials and eventually to market.
</p>
<h4>Our Vision</h4>
<p>
  Clinical trials are very expensive. Our indication agnostic platform technology is designed to transform current pre-clinical R&D practices
that de-risks downstream clinical trials.
</p>
<h4>Our Mission</h4>
<p>We are committed to ensuring the <b>safety</b> & <b>efficacy</b> of treatments. We are on a mission to eliminate avoidable costs, delays,
and achieve greater reliability for new treatments.</p>.
