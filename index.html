	<h2>Strap line.</h2>
	We are MVT <i>in</i> Silico (MVTIS) who deploy fundamental scientific principles to build effective medical treatments & research
	solutions.

	<h2>Public pitch deck. (June 2025).</h2>

	You can find out our public pitch <a href="mvtisPublicPitch_June2025.pdf">here.</a>

	<h2>About Us.</h2>
	MVTIS is a life sciences innovation company that presently provides CM&S services for the life sciences. 
	We provide evidence for products that our clients wish to patent. We encompass a wide range of capabilities from 
	molecular dynamics to whole body blood flow circulation. In addition,
	we have internal pipelines to develop our own products that include software as medical devices (SAMD), a novel pharma hit identification
	pipeline, and three physics medical devices.
	<h2> The Challenge.</h2>
	There is a high failure rate in pharma and MedTech R&D from discovery stage to market.
	A major reason for this is our lack of understanding of the system that the treatment is intended to treat.
	<h2>The Solution.</h2>
	We use computer modelling & simulation to understand the system that the treatment is intended to treat.
	To do so, we have developed our proprietary software called "MVT Software Suite." that has modules that are 
	capable of simulating the system from the molecular level to the whole body level to digital clinical trials.
	<h2>Vision.</h2>
	To reduce the world's burden of critical illness through a computer modelling & simulation (CM&S) first approach,
	and become a life sciences manufacturer.
	<h2>Sectors we serve.</h2>
	<li>Hypertension, obesity, and aging.</li>
	<li>FemTech.</li>
	<li>Drug delivery systems.</li>
	<li>Biophysical and physiological evidence generation for regulatory approval.</li>
	<h2>Services & products.</h2>
	Our services and products are for collaborations and internal pipelines.
	<li>CAD modelling.</li>
	<li>FEA analysis.</li>
	<li>CFD simulations.</li>
	<li>Genetics.</li>
	<li>Molecular simulations.</li>
	<li>Bespoke biophysical computer models.</li>
	<li>Non animal models: lab on a chip (microfluidic devices).</li>
	<li>Original and curated+annotated data repositories.</li>
	<h2>How it works.</h2>
	We have a few user uptake meetings, followed by design of the project. The projects are typically 2 to 14 
	months and our pricing is at an hourly rate. An NDA and other relevant agreements to protect all parties are executed early in the process. Upon agreement by all parties, 
	we perform the project with regular reporting and agile management. We provide a report (and all other agreed material) 
	at the end of the project which contains information (diagrams, text, tables, designs, computer files) for inclusion 
	into your evidence dossier. The IP is yours, unless we agree otherwise. As a core value, we maintain professional 
	integrity and confidentiality.

	<h2>Partners & Funders.</h2>
	As of January 2025, we are working with three companies and two university research groups. 
	We are funded by an initial founder's investment and government grants. Recently, we received
	grants from BioTalent Canada and BioHubNet for which we are grateful.

	<h2>The Team.</h2>
	We are an expert team consisting of computational modellers, biophysicists, pharmacologists, mechanical engineers, and university
	professors. In addition, the company has two employees as of 2025.
	<li>Dr. S. R. Kharche. President, CEO, and Chief Science Officer. (founder)</li>
Dr. Kharche is a seasoned scientist and an expert in scientific computing. His expertise includes R&D software development,
computational physiology, cardiovascular sciences, blood flow fluid dynamics, and molecular dynamics. He has published a wide spectrum of journal
<a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=hwkcYRMAAAAJ&view_op=list_works&sortby=pubdate">articles</a> which
has led to the inception of MVT <i>in</i> Silico company. Over the past two years (2023 to 2025), he has gained valuable
hands on experience of the business ecosystem in Canada and elsewhere. He is an ideal founder to lead the Company in its 
scientific and technical programs.<br> <br>
