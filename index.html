	<h2>Strap Line.</h2>
	We are MVT <i>in</i> Silico who deploy fundamental scientific principles to build effective medical treatments.
	<h2>About Us.</h2>
	MVTIS is a life sciences company that presently provides CM&S services for the life sciences. 
	We provide evidence for products that our clients wish to patent. We encompass a wide range of capabilities from 
	molecular drug-enzyme interactions to whole body blood flow circulation.
	<h2> The Challenge.</h2>
	There is a high failure rate in the development of medical treatments from discovery stage to market.
	A major reason for this is our lack of understanding of the system that the treatment is intended to treat.
	<h2>The Solution.</h2>
	We use computer modelling & simulation to understand the system that the treatment is intended to treat.
	To do so, we have developed our proprietary software called "MVT Software Suite." that has modules that are 
	capable of simulating the system from the molecular level to the whole body level to digital clinical trials.
	<h2>Vision</h2>
	Reduce the burden of critical illness treatments through a computer modelling & simulation (CM&S) first approach,
	and become a manufacturer of medical treatments.
	<h2>How it works.</h2>
	We have a few user uptake meetings, followed by design of the project. The projects are typically 2 to 14 
	months at a reasonable pricing. An NDA is executed early in the process. Upon agreement by all parties, 
	we perform the project with regular reporting and agile management. We provide a report (and all other agreed material) 
	at the end of the project which contains information (diagrams, text, tables, designs, computer files) for inclusion 
	into your evidence dossier. The IP is yours, unless we agree otherwise. As a core value, we maintain professional 
	integrity and confidentiality.
	<h2>Partners & Funders.</h2>
	As of January 2025, we are working with three companies and two university research groups. 
	We are funded by an initial founder's investment and government grants.

	<The Team.</h2>
	Legal arrangements are being worked out, and the team will be announced at an appropriate stage.
