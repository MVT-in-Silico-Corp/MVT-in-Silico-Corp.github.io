<h4>MVT in Silico's Impact Thesis</h4>
<p>
Our prediction-validation life sciences platform helps companies to reduce their pre-clinical animal use 
by 75% (300 to 60), which shortens their R&D cycles by 80% (3 years to 8 months), and prepares the client's 
product for efficient phase I trials. Our safety, efficacy, and quality assessments that are essential for 
the medical treatment's regulatory progress. Our approach encompasses most targets in the third goal of 
the 17 UN Sustainable Development Goals (e.g., 3.7 Ensuring universal access to sexual and reproductive 
health-care services, 3.9 Reducing the number of deaths and illnesses from hazardous chemicals and pollution, 
3.C Increasing health financing and the recruitment, development, training and retention of the health work force, 
3.D Strengthening the capacity for early warning of global health risks). In the long term, we will play a part 
in the transition to non-animal testing that is reliably more human relevant.
