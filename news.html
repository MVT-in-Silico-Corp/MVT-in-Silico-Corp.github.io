<h4>RESI JPM Conference – San Francisco, January 2026: Highlights from MVT in Silico</h4>
A few days ago, MVT in Silico attended the RESI JPM conference in San Francisco, and it was a jam-packed, 
inspiring few days. Here’s a snapshot of what we got out of it.
<br>
Regulatory Insights.<br>
At a pre-conference session with UCSF faculty and FDA officers, we got a much clearer picture of how 
regulatory science works and how regulators operate. This gave us some practical guidance on fine-tuning our plans and 
strategies - and even opened doors to future conversations with scientists whose interests align with ours.
Investment and Fundraising. The conference was full of investors active in life sciences and biotech. We pitched, got 
feedback, and combined with some deep research by @Harpreet Kaur, we now have a clear sense of which VCs we’ll approach for our fundraising later this year. We also discovered some accelerators in our space and have already submitted applications.
Partnerships and Collaborations. We met a lot of peers, startups, and senior leaders from larger pharma companies. Excitingly, we’ve started conversations with two startups about supporting virtual clinical trials in Phase I. Plus, meetings with managers from a big pharma company are scheduled for February/March. One thing became clear: every startup seems to have its own unique path, without any underscoring formula for success.
Licensing and Competitive Landscape. At a post-conference showcase, UCSD highlighted developments in neurology, oncology, and other areas -potential opportunities for licensing. But while their innovations are impressive, it is clear that the Canadian ecosystem is a strong competitor (maybe even ahead in some ways).
<br>
Takeaway.<br>
There’s a strong appetite for the niche products and services we’re building, and the conference gave us great 
visibility into where we fit in the investor–large pharma–startup ecosystem.
<br>
In other news.<br>
San Francisco is an amazing city, and the surrounding countryside is stunning, definitely worth a second 
(and third, and fourth, …) explore!
