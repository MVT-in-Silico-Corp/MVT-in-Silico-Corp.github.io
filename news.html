<h5>MVT in Silico’s Dermal Drug Administration Simulation digital twin.</h5>
MVT in Silico is a drug development company building the MVT Physiology Engine, 
a proprietary cyber-physical platform designed to deliver human-relevant pharmacometrics. 
Our mission is to reduce (and ultimately replace) animal experimentation, lower the burden of 
Phase I clinical trials, and provide regulatory-grade evidence that reduces friction during 
drug approval. As a downstream benefit, our platform supports foundational advances in tech-bio 
and basic science. Our MVP is scheduled for launch later this year (2026), which is part of our 
staggered multistage commercial launch.<br>
Mammalian skin is a complex multi-layered organ consisting of multiple layers, fat tissue, muscle tissue, 
blood vessels, and lymphatics. The skin is and obvious and widely used route to apply/deliver biochemicals 
ranging from topical cosmetics to deep tissue injections. Using the skin avoids multiple processes such as 
rapid metabolism and excretion augmenting the chances of the drug reaching its intended target tissue, 
which is relevant for expensive medicines such as biologics. Unsurprisingly, the safety of the delivery of 
new drugs thru’ the skin (and devices used to deliver these drugs) is of paramount interest to regulators 
(Health Canada, US FDA, all others) which requires evidence. Measuring the efficacy & safety of a new
 drug’s delivery to the human patients’ skin adds to a company’s R&D expense, prolongs cycle time, is 
 often harmful to the human (healthy) volunteers, making it a significant bottleneck that must be 
 resolved using alternative means. The evidence generation must be undertaken in light of the main drug 
 being mixed with several other biochemicals called excipients. Whereas animal & human testing at an 
 appropriate stage is essential, we now provide an alternative assessment instrument that gives you a 
 reliable operating range of dosing which can be used to streamline your animal/bench experiments & 
 first in human trials.<br>

<bold>Today, we announce our validated Dermal Drug Administration Simulation module.</bold><br>

We have implemented & tested our knowledge driven physiologically detailed computational model 
(i.e. completely transparent & reproducible as not much of our work is a black box) that provides 
time profiles of a given drug in the presence of several competing mechanisms (vascular uptake & health, 
diffusion, …). It is designed for use in population simulations. We are already using it in our service 
to our pilot clients in assessing the superiority of their patent pending invention to the current 
standard of care. Other such modules follow.<br>

<h5>MVT in Silico Announces Deployment-Ready Cardiotoxicity Assay Aligned with FDA Requirements</h5>
MVT in Silico is a drug development company building the MVT Physiology Engine, a proprietary 
cyber-physical platform designed to deliver human-relevant pharmacometrics. 
Our mission is to reduce (and ultimately replace) animal experimentation, lower the burden of 
Phase I clinical trials, and provide regulatory-grade evidence that reduces friction during drug approval. 
As a downstream benefit, our platform supports foundational advances in tech-bio and basic science. 
Our MVP is scheduled for launch later this year.<br>
Today, we announce the availability of our <bold>validated and deployment-ready cardiotoxicity assay</bold>.<br>
Demonstrating that a drug or drug-device combination is non-toxic to the heart is a critical prerequisite for 
clinical use and a key screening step in drug development. One of the most serious manifestations of cardiotoxicity 
is the induction of cardiac arrhythmias—an outcome that must be rigorously assessed and avoided. Regulatory authorities, 
including Health Canada, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), and the European Medicines Agency (EMA), 
require objective, data-driven metrics to establish cardiac safety. These metrics are typically derived from biopsies 
or patient-specific hiPSC derived cardiomyocytes and must be generated using a validated, approved, 
reproducible scientific processes.<br>
MVT in Silico now offers a cardiotoxicity testing service powered by our proprietary assay, designed to 
satisfy FDA regulatory expectations, and for internal decision making. Its development has resulted in 
proprietary intellectual property that strengthens our platform and service offering.<br><br>

<h5>RESI JPM Conference – San Francisco, January 2026: Highlights from MVT in Silico</h5>
A few days ago, MVT in Silico attended the RESI JPM conference in San Francisco, and it was a jam-packed, 
inspiring few days. Here’s a snapshot of what we got out of it.
<br>
Regulatory Insights.<br>
At a pre-conference session with UCSF faculty and FDA officers, we got a much clearer picture of how 
regulatory science works and how regulators operate. This gave us some practical guidance on fine-tuning our plans and 
strategies - and even opened doors to future conversations with scientists whose interests align with ours.
Investment and Fundraising. The conference was full of investors active in life sciences and biotech. We pitched, got 
feedback, and combined with some deep research by @Harpreet Kaur, we now have a clear sense of which VCs we’ll approach for our fundraising later this year. We also discovered some accelerators in our space and have already submitted applications.
Partnerships and Collaborations. We met a lot of peers, startups, and senior leaders from larger pharma companies. Excitingly, we’ve started conversations with two startups about supporting virtual clinical trials in Phase I. Plus, meetings with managers from a big pharma company are scheduled for February/March. One thing became clear: every startup seems to have its own unique path, without any underscoring formula for success.
Licensing and Competitive Landscape. At a post-conference showcase, UCSD highlighted developments in neurology, oncology, and other areas -potential opportunities for licensing. But while their innovations are impressive, it is clear that the Canadian ecosystem is a strong competitor (maybe even ahead in some ways).
<br>
Takeaway.<br>
There’s a strong appetite for the niche products and services we’re building, and the conference gave us great 
visibility into where we fit in the investor–large pharma–startup ecosystem.
<br>
In other news.<br>
San Francisco is an amazing city, and the surrounding countryside is stunning, definitely worth a second 
(and third, and fourth, …) explore!
